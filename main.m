% Define the communication rate of this system as  [bits/channel use], where (n,k) means that the system sends one of  messages using n channel uses. The channel impairs encoded (i.e. transmitted) symbols to generate . The decoder (i.e. receiver) produces an estimate, , of the transmitted message, . 
% The input message is defined as a one-hot vector , which is defined as a vector whose elements are all zeros except the  one. The channel is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) that adds noise to achieve a given energy per bit to noise power density ratio, . 
% Define a (7,4) autoencoder network with energy normalization and a training  of 3 dB. In [1], authors showed that two fully connected layers for both the encoder (transmitter) and the decoder (receiver) provides the best results with minimal complexity. Input layer (featureInputLayer) accepts a one-hot vector of length M. The encoder has two fully connected layers (fullyConnectedLayer). The first one has M inputs and M outputs and is followed by an ReLU layer (reluLayer). The second fully connected layer has M inputs and n outputs and is followed by the normalization layer (helperAEWNormalizationLayer.m). The encoder layers are followed by the AWGN channel layer (helperAEWAWGNLayer.m). The output of the channel is passed to the decoder layers. The first decoder layer is a fully connected layer that has n inputs and M outputs and is followed by an ReLU layer. Second fully connected layer has M inputs and M outputs and is followed by a softmax layer (softmaxLayer), which outputs the probability of each M symbols. The classification layer (classificationLayer) outputs the most probable transmitted symbol from 0 to M-1.

% Train Autoencoder
% Run the helperAEWTrainWirelessAutoencoder.m function to train a (2,2) autoencoder with energy normalization. This function uses the trainingOptions function to select 
% Adam (adaptive moment estimation) optimizer, 
% Initial learning rate of 0.01, 
% Maximum epochs of 15,
% Minibatch size of 20*M,
% Piecewise learning schedule with drop period of 10 and drop factor of 0.1.
% Then, the helperAEWTrainWirelessAutoencoder.m function runs the trainNetwork function to train the autoencoder network with the selected options. Finally, this function separates the network into encoder and decoder parts. Encoder starts with the input layer and ends after the normalization layer. Decoder starts after the channel layer and ends with the classification layer. A feature input layer is added at the beginning of the decoder.

% Plot the constellation using the helperAEWPlotConstellation.m function. The trained (2,2) autoencoder converges on a QPSK constellation with a phase shift as the optimal constellation for the channel conditions experienced. The (2,4) autoencoder with energy normalization converges to a 16PSK constellation with a phase shift. Note that, energy normalization forces every symbol to have unit energy and places the symbols on the unit circle. Given this constraint, best constellation is a PSK constellation with equal angular distance between symbols. The (2,4) autoencoder with average power normalization converges to a three-tier constellation of 1-6-9 symbols. Average power normalization forces the symbols to have unity average power over time. This constraint results in an APSK constellation, which is different than the conventional QAM or APSK schemes. Note that, this network configuration may also converge to a two-tier constellation with 7-9 symbols based on the random initial condition used during training. The last plot shows the 2-D mapping of the 7-D constellation generated by the (7,4) autoencoder with energy constraint. 2-D mapping is obtained using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method (see tsne function).

The (7,4) autoencoder BLER performance approaches the ML decoding of (7,4) Hamming code, when trained with 3 dB .

% Conclusions and Further Exploration
% The BLER results show that it is possible for autoencoders to learn joint coding and modulation schemes in an unsupervised way. It is even possible to train an autoencoder with R=1 to obtain a coding gain as compared to traditional methods. The example also shows the effect of hyperparameters such as  on the BLER performance.
